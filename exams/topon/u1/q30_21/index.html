            Rock is a broad genre of popular music that originated in the early 1950s in the United States and would lead to a wide range of different styles in the mid-1960s and later, particularly in that country and the United Kingdom. It has its roots in the rock and roll of the 50s, a style born directly from genres such as blues, rhythm and blues (belonging to African-American music) and country. It also drew heavily on electric blues and folk, as well as incorporating influences from jazz and classical music, among other sources. Instrumentally, rock has focused on the electric guitar, usually as part of a group consisting of drums, bass, one or more singers, and sometimes keyboard instruments such as organ and piano. Usually, rock is based on songs in 4/4 time and a verse-chorus structure; however, the genus has become extremely diverse, and common characteristics are difficult to define. Like pop music, lyrics often focus on romantic love, but also deal with a wide range of other themes with frequent focus on the social, personal, and political. </br>
